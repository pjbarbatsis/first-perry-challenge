Hi!

A couple of things to note about this series of tests.
1) Inconsistent use of Assert. I realize I could add Assertions to each of these tests, but they ended up feeling
redundant, so I stopped.
2) Lack of POM. A POM would make this code a lot easier and DRYer.
3) Hard coded resources. It seems like we're both in the middle of figuring out what to do with our resources. I figure
that the conventions will be made more apparent in time.
